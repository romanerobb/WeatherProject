# WeatherProject
A project I've created using HMTL, CSS, Javascript, Express, and more

# TasksList
- Build a server using Express.
- Utilize the Openweather API.
- Parse The JSON data.
- Allow users to search for specific cities.
- 

# Development Notes
- Make sure you use Nodemon (npm install -g nodemon # or using yarn: yarn global add nodemon) and run your server via: nodemon app.js instead of node app.js. My server would not "refresh" when I made changes until I installed and ran it via nodemon.
- Use: node rs app.js to restart your server if you experience any errors.
